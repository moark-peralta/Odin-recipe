    <h1>Filipino Spaghetti</h1>
    <img src="../images/lumpia.jpg" alt="Lumpiang Shanghai">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic lumpiang Shanghai recipe is a savory ground pork mixture, usually with finely chopped vegetables and seasoned with Asian sauces to make the filling even more flavorful, rolled into fresh flour wrappers. These are then fried and served with a similarly tasty sauce. </p>
    <p>What makes these fried spring rolls so good is really the filling. It’s cooked just until the filling is cooked through so each bite is an explosion of the tender pork filling encased in the crisp texture of the fried wrapper. It’s also pretty easy to make a big batch with little effort. </p>
    <p>This is finger party food at its best! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1/2 kilogram pork</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 small carrot</strong> finely grated</li>
            <li><strong>1 small red onion</strong>finely grated</li>
            <li><strong>4 cloves garlic</strong>grated</li>
            <li><strong>1 large egg</strong></li>
            <li><strong>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon sugar</strong></li>
            <li><strong>12 pieces large lumpia wrappers</strong></li>
            <li><strong>salt</strong> to taste</li>
            <li><strong>ground black pepper</strong> to taste</li>
            <li><strong>egg</strong> for egg wash</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine ground pork, garlic, onion, carrots, egg, oyster sauce, and sugar. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix until well incorporated.</li>
            <li>To assemble, put about 1 to 2 tablespoons filling near the lower part of the wrapper. Fold the wrapper over and roll the wrapper thin, sealing the edges with egg. Slice the lumpia into three using a sharp knife.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook, heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Place the lumpia in the hot oil, and cook for around 5 minutes each side. Fry in batches. Remove from heat, and drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Serve with sweet chili sauce, banana ketchup, or your sauce of choice.</li>
        </ol>
