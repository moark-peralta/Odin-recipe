    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>is a classic Filipino dish made of thinly sliced beef braised in a mixture of citrus juice (more commonly, the local fruit, calamansi), soy sauce, onions, garlic, and pepper. A delicious medley of salty, tangy, and savory flavors, it's traditionally served with steamed rice.</p>
    
    <p>Also known as beefsteak, it was adapted from the Spanish <em>bistec encebollado</em> to suit our local tastes and indigenous ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li><strong>500 grams beef sirloin</strong> thinly sliced and cut into pieces</li>

            <li>In a saute pan over high heat, heat enough oil to cover the bottom. Add onions and saute, stirring, until just softened. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
